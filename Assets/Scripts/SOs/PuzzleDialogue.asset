    IntroDialogueOne: Welcome small challenger, I am Kano; the most righteous of
      us Zodiacs. I see you have decided to partake in such a grand challenge despite
      your size. That is indeed commendable! My knight is honored to face you in
      a duel!
    IntroDialogueTwo: "Hello Corvus, I am Sir **** the Rooster Zodiac, but my fellow
      clergymen call me Richard. No knight wishes to concede a duel; that is an act
      of cowardice! May death greet one of us with open arms at the climax of this
      battle of intellect\r."
    OneStarDialogue: "I believe this duel is unresolved, small one. A worthy subject
      of my rule shows courage at Death\u2019s door\r.\n"
    TwoStarDialogue: Alas, I have been struck down by a fine warrior! May the light
      guide you on your path to becoming a Zodiac. We shall meet again, Sir Corvus.

    IntroDialogueOne: Hello little raven, I am Big Dog the Dog Zodiac and this bad
      puppy here is Lady. Back in my biker days, I was head of the BDB (Big Dog Bonez)
      Biker Club because of my superior Alpha mentality, so I won't be making it
      easy for you youngsters. Brad here can attest to that... Brad.
    IntroDialogueTwo: Ahhh this peak form.. hmm? Ah hello! I am Brad the Horse Zodiac.
      Just got a quick pump in while waiting for you. What took so long? Nevermind
      that, shorter breaks between reps is better anyways. This puzzle will test
      the limits of your body, stimulating your frontal lobe in order for you to
      perform better mentally.
    OneStarDialogue: "Hmmm, too RUFF for you? We\u2019ll see you again when you\u2019ve
      developed that Alpha mentality\r."
    TwoStarDialogue: "Excellent work amateur. I\u2019ll turn you into a Greek God
      in no time. Win the challenge and I\u2019ll give you my workout routine, as
      well as these supplements I take every day to boost muscle development!\r"

      it takesss one more ssshhottt to make progressssss.
    TwoStarDialogue: Yo yo you made that look like a walk in the park, but things
      are about to turn dark. Keep thinking outside the box, your next opponents
      are the Dragon and the Ox!
  - zodiacOneName: Ox

    IntroDialogueOne: "Halt! You stand before Bellows the Ox, the mightiest warrior
      of the Zodiacs. I see I stand before Corvus, the challenger and\u2026finest
      hot dog vendor in the land. Before we begin, be warned\u2026 this puzzle was
      designed by the likes of my fighting spirit and this\u2026 robot."
    IntroDialogueTwo: Calling me a robot is quite rude. Hello Corvus, I am Ryo the
      Dragon Zodiac. Long before I met the Emperor, the world was a small and unforgiving
      place. I traveled its lands and seas, taking anything I wanted with no regard
      for the innocent. Now I am reborn, leaving many of those toxic parts of me
      behind.
    OneStarDialogue: Huff... your strength and spirit is only partial, like Ryo's
      body over here. Return again when you are ready to truly test yourself. Hi-ya!
    TwoStarDialogue: "Hmm\u2026 I can detect that you easily adapt to anything the
      world throws at you, Corvus the Raven. Alas, it took another chance at life
      to realize what you have already mastered!\r"

    zodiacTwoSprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 2620659efcf4540719fde63caf710a22, type: 3}
    IntroDialogueOne: "It\u2019s wonderful to meet you Corvus, I am the one and only
      Pig Zodiac, but please call me Pour-Que. I may have bellied up the race, but
      you know the saying, slow and steady\u2026 Welllll, I still lost. Anyways,
      my bestie Mulu here makes some killer tea that\u2019s got.. what is it again?"
    IntroDialogueTwo: Hello Corvus, welcome to my lovely garden! I am Mulu the Goat
      Zodiac. This place has such a relaxing aura that I have a bah-ah-ah-ad habit
      of falling asleep right here! The key to this feeling is the scent of chrysanthemums,
      which is the secret ingredient for my tea!
    OneStarDialogue: "You seem as lost as a hog on ice. Maybe drink some of Mulu\u2019s
      christmas-mom tea and try again!\r"
    TwoStarDialogue: "YAY you did it! Take a flower for your journey, and I hope
      you\u2019ll join Pour-Que and me for tea after you win!\r"

    zodiacTwoSprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 556bcc402a4a54c7ba7f7a84e2c8fb28, type: 3}
    IntroDialogueOne: "Well, well\u2026 look at that. I have seen your intellect
      be tested by the other Zodiacs, Corvus, and I am quite impressed. But a wise
      man once told me, \u201Ca god doesn\u2019t know all, but knows how to achieve
      all\u201D."
    IntroDialogueTwo: As the Rat Zodiac and your last opponent, I, Mino the Wise,
      shall present your final puzzle. Show me what you can achieve!
    OneStarDialogue: "Perhaps I was wrong to suspect you could become more than just
      a rug-rat\u2026 No matter, I can wait another 2000 years for the next candidate."
    TwoStarDialogue: "Never\u2026 never in my life have I been outsmarted, especially
      by a child. 2000 years of building knowledge has brought me to my first pupil\u2026
      you. Let me teach \tyou so that you can one day teach me."
